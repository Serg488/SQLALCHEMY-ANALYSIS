# SQLALCHEMY-ANALYSIS
In this challenge i was be touching more on SQLALCHEMY, practicing using flask api to figure out weather data for a vacation trip. I will analyze climate about an area in Holulu, Hawaii trying to get average, min and max temperatures. The data i'm analyzing will be in my "Resources" folder inside the repository. Python, Pandas, ORM queries & Matplotlib will be used to explore the climate database. By caculating the previous 12 months temperatures i am able to then visualize it making a bar chart with the temperatures and frequency. Making a bar chart with the precipitation in inces for each month will also help me analyze how good the weather will be for the trip. Last with the query's i nuild i can use flask api to design my climate app.
